Hey there, I am Varenyam Bhardwaj

I'm just a random internet user who plays genshin impact and watches anime ~90% of the time~ ahem ahem no one should know that but i code.

I could classify myself as a data science enthusiast (see what i did there?) and i am interested in deep learning, app development with kotlin and also Im looking into backend using rust

One of the few things that I love doing is trying out the most absurd ways to do the most common tasks. Oh you want to make an app using C++ sure lets do it!
